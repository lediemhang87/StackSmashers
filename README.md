# Stack Smashers
---

Given an infinite amount of material, your goal is to build a colorful tall tower, starting from the ground and reaching higher and higher—through the clouds and into the depths of space.

This game is inspired by the Stack game by Ketchapp. In the original game, the objective is to build a tower by carefully aligning blocks on top of each other as they move horizontally. Each time a new block is stacked, it moves back and forth at a certain speed. You tap the screen to stop it, trying to align it perfectly with the block below. If you succeed, the block stacks seamlessly; if you’re off, the part that doesn’t align falls off, making the next block smaller and more difficult to stack.

In this project, we are planning to implement 2 modes. 
The first mode is going to be the same feature as the original Stack game.
For the second mode, your task is also building a tower by stacking blocks one on top of the other. But there's a catch: physics plays a big role, and keeping the tower balanced is part of the challenge! As you keep stacking, each block that isn’t perfectly aligned makes the tower more unstable. The higher the tower gets, the more unstable it becomes due to gravity. If the blocks are too uneven, the whole tower may tilt and eventually collapse. This means that stacking with precision is essential for reaching new heights.
